# Artificial-Intelligence
A repository in which I added all my artificial intelligence projects.
All the projects were done using Python 3.7 and all the usual libraries for this kind of work(Numpy, Matplotlib and others).
I used the PyCharm IDE, but none of the code is dependent on anything from PyCharm.

Every project has its own directory. What follows is a short description of every project.
I created documentation for all the projects. The documentation is written in Romanian.

1. Random Search and Random Hill-Climbing for the 0/1 Knapsack Problem;
2. Tabu Search for the 0/1 Knapsack Problem and Simulated Annealing for TSP;
3. Genetic Algorithms for the 0/1 Knapsack Problem and TSP. Multiple crossover and mutation operators were used;
4. Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization for Schwefel function(more detail in the word document);

Some of the code has comments and I plan on adding more comments when I have the time.
